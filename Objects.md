# Objects

- All objects are made from other objects
- The act of creating a composite object is object composition
- Is-a relations are the tightest form of coupling in OO and should be avoided
- __FAVOR OBJECT COMPOSITION OVER CLASS INHERITANCE__
- Aggregation composes objects into enumerable collections
- Delegation composes objects by linking together an object delegation chain
- Concatenation composes objects by extending an existing object with new properties
