# Transducers

## Compose top to bottom

Transducers under standard function composition
apply top to bottom/left to right. Ie, using
`compose(f, g)` means compose f __after__ g.
Transudcers wrap around other transducers under composition.
In other words, a transducer does its thing then calls
the next transudcer of the pipeline, which has the effect
of turning the execution stack inside out.

Imagine you have papers, labeled f, g, n. Take the top
sheet off the stack and place it on the top of an
adjacent stack. That adjacent stack will then be n, g, f.

## Transducer Rules

1. Initialization: Given no initial accumulator value, a transudcer must call the step function to produce a valid initial value to act on. The value should represent the empty state. Eg, an accumulator that accumulates an array should supply an empty array when its step function is called with no arguments.
2. Early termination: A process that uses transducers must check for and stop when it receives a reduced accumulator value. Additionally, a transducer step function that uses a nested reduce must check for and conveyu reduced values when they are encountered.
3. Completion (optional): Some transducing processes never complete, but those that do should call the completion function to produce a final value or flush state, and stateful transducers should supply a completion operation that cleans up any accumulated resources and potentially produces one final value.
